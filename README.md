# List-Viewbots
Finds similar names in twitch viewer lists.

This utility will fetch the current viewers of a given twitch channel, and will scan through the viewer names looking for names which are similar. Similar names can indicate viewbots, for example TwitchViewer01, TwitchViewer02, and TwitchViewer03 are likely to be the same person using multiple accounts.

The config.txt file may be edited to alter the Twitch channel from which the viewers are requested, and the similarity threshold required for two names to be listed as "similar". The threshold is in %, i.e. 100 is identical and 0 is completely different. config.txt expects two lines of text, each optional, in the format: 

    threshold=x
    channel=x

where x is the desired threshold/channel. If no config file is present, or if the lines inside it are badly formatted or absent, the default values below will apply:

    threshold=75
    channel=valkia

The python source is included, however as it requires python to be installed, the compiled exe is also included which can be run on any windows machine. The exe file was generated by the command:

`pyinstaller "List Viewbots.py" --onefile`

pyinstaller can be downloaded via:

`pip install pyinstaller`

or at https://www.pyinstaller.org/downloads.html
